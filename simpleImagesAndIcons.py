An example that uses most of the list methods:[66.25, -1, 333, 1, 1234.5, 333]>>> a.reverse()>>> a[333, 1234.5, 1, 333, -1, 66.25]>>> a.sort()>>> a[-1, 1, 66.25, 333, 333, 1234.5]>>> a.pop()1234.5>>> a[-1, 1, 66.25, 333, 333]You might have noticed that methods like insert, remove or sort that only modify the list have no return value printed â€“ they return the default None.
